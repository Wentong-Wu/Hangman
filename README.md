# Hangman Project Documentation Guideline

> Created hangman game on Visual Studio Code using Python programming language

## Milestone 1 - User Input - Ask_letter method

- Built a method which asks the user for its input making sure the input is correctly entered before calling another function. All the methods can only be called if the hangman class is created to ensure that the user is intended to play the hangman game (Object-Oriented Programming)

## Milestone 2 - Defining the initializer

- Defining all the attributes in the Hangman class using 'def __init__' inside the hangman class. The word will be chosen in the initializer so that each new game you play, a new word will be chosen from a word list.

## Milestone 3 - Check_letter and draw_hangman.

- Check_letter method is a method inside hangman class to check if the letter input by the user is correct or not, if input is correct then it will display it into the console (also include dupe letters) else you would lose a life.

- draw_hangman mehtod is a method that displays the hangman game. It requires to pass in the life parameter so that it will display the correct image when called.

## Conclusions

- This is the first time i've used python language. It was quite interesting, fun and very readable by user. Learned the basic syntax and statements for python.
